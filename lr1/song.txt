--ENEMY--
Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you, you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Look out for yourself
My enemy
Look out for yourself
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you, you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (ha)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Look out for yourself
My enemy (yeah)
Look out for yourself

Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it
And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'
They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint
Look out for yourself

--BELIEVER--
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
